\title{Chapter 1 Selected Solutions For Stable Matching Problems}

\maketitle
\textbf{Problem 3: }

The problem does not always have a stable pair of schedules. Consider
that A has two programs A1, A2 with ratings 10, 50 respectively; B
has two programs B1 and B2 with ratings 8, 20 respectively. We can
show that there is no stable match for this configuration.

\textbf{Problem 4: }

See C++ implementation of the stable matching implementation for ``National
Resident Matching Problem''.
